# Introduction

The story takes place during the Reclamation period. The discovery of a vast landmass to the north fuel the population with a sense of adventure. In time, people set out, explorers, researchers, treasure hunters, archaeologists, etc. seeking wealth, knowledge and power.

Ten years have passed, Dagg was on the cusp of a renaissance. The energetic sentiment, which took over the people the decade before, has not slowed down. On the contrary, even more expense are being invested into the exploration effort, with a strong focus on government-funded expeditions.

In the previous decades, many dig sites were found and excavated, unearthing trinkets and artifacts of ages long past. From these findings, scholars have theorized the existence of a civilization countless ages before. In their possession were technologies far more advanced, and evident by various recovered artifacts, a vastly deeper understanding of magic.

During an expedition into the Kyne forest, a castle was discovered. Initial architectural assessments indicate that the castle bears many similarities to the older buildings and districts in Drene. At once, an expedition was swiftly organized, composed of individuals ranging from archaeologists, historians, linguistics to scouts, rangers, mercenaries and mages.

The player is part of this group.

# Chapter 1

The rediscovery of the dark continent occurred one thousand and twenty-three years after the collapse. News of an unknown landmass to the north spread like wildfire, burning away the cynical sentiment that had been prevalent within much of the population at the time.

Suddenly, there was a promise, of treasure, fame, knowledge,... The power to take hold of one's life was again in one's own hands. Abject rejection and cynicism turned into hopeful enthusiasm. People started looking to the north, and in time, they made the journey. Destiny was something tangible. This time period was proudly called "Reclamation".

A decade has passed. Last month, news of a recently discovered castle, the first of its kind, arrived in Drene. An expedition was quickly organized. After 2 weeks, the group set out, within 1 month, they have come close to castle Syn'et.

As the expedition emerges from the dripping foliage of the forest, a host of wildly varying emotions spreads throughout each of its members. The stone ground, still wet from the rain two nights before, continues stretching briefly ahead before narrowing and dropping sharply to the chasm below.

On the other side of the cliff is a mountain at a similar elevation. Upon the relatively flat surface looms a colossal fortress, its surface scarred with the wounds inflicted by the cold indifference of time. The castle's imposing stone wall circles the mountain's edge, curving slightly.

From this side of the rift extends a stone bridge, roughly 15 feet wide from a glance. The bridge seems to be made from the same rectangular stonework as the castle beyond. Other than the minor potholes and black stains on the surface, the sky-walk stands firm above the foggy abyss below.

At the other end lies the destination of your journey.
