Dagg is a peninsula located at the south-eastern point of the continent. Initially colonized by [[Kaspian Empire|the old empire]], Dagg eventually became isolated from the rest of the world due to the inaccessibility presented by a multitude of geological and oceanography features. Despite being the cause of many logistical issues during [[Kaspian Empire|the Kaspian era]], this isolation characteristic was the largest contributing factor to the survival of the region, [[Collapse|post-collapse]].

### Geography

#### Boundaries

Dagg marks the separate between two large seas, at the eastern shore, [[Kaspian Sea]] and at the south-western shore, [[Serpent Sea]]. To the north is [[Drukar Range]], a large mountainous region originating from the eastern shore, extending southward and finally, curves south-west to form a shield that shelters most of Dagg from the main continent. Finally, At the south-western foot of The Drukar Range is [[Timeless Valley]], known to most as the only feasible entrance into Dagg.

#### Notable Feature

##### Drukari Plateau

[[Drukari Plateaus]] is a series of flat plains at varying elevations, spanning ~500 km along the southern edge of [[Drukar Range]]. The Drukari Plateaus houses diverse biological features that are distinct from the rest of Dagg.

##### Stilled River

The [[Stilled River]] is the central river that flows perpendicular from the eastern shore into the central plain. About 250 km into the mainland, the Stilled splits into two. The south-east branch eventually flows south and form the [[Ailen River|Ailen]].

The remaining branch continues to flow south-west for another ~300 km before splitting again, spawning the [Baltic River] which flows south out to [[Broken Bay]], joining [[Serpent Sea]]. The other branch continues flowing south-west to [[Royal Lake]].

##### Ailen River

The [[Ailen River]] is one of the branch that split off from the [[Stilled River]] ~250 km into the mainland from the eastern shore. The Ailen flows south-east towards the [[Kef Mountains|Kef]] and is considered the main contributor to the formation of [[Ailen Lake]], one of the two largest lake in Dagg.

##### Ailen Lake

Although considered to be the second-largest lake in Dagg, [[Ailen Lake]] has a much greater depth.

##### Sem Woods

Starting from the split between the [[Stilled River|Stilled]] and the [[Ailen River|Ailen]], [[Sem Woods]] spread in parallel to the Stilled and stretches south, ending at [[Golan Hills]].

##### Kef Mountains

Parallel to the [[Drukar Range]], [[Kef Mountains|Kef]] lies south-east of [[Sem Woods]] and runs from the eastern coast to separate the main plains from the [[Calm Desert]] to the south.

##### Calm Desert

The [[Calm Desert]] is a massive area that formed to cover most of the southern region of Dagg. It is currently unknown how a desert this expansive comes to be in a region with such a moderate climate.
